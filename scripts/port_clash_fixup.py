:mod: scripts.port_clash_fixup
=========================

Prints existing port clashes and fixes them.
For every clash, the interface that was modified the first is kept, but
for all the other ones a new port is found, and the associated
AP's configuration version is bumped.
This is intended to be used only once.

Run with python manage.py runscript port_clash_fixup
