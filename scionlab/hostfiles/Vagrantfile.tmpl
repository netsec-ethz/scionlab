      time sync: virtualbox host timesync is disabled to avoid issues on hosts
      with bad time that we cannot work around (see GetHostTimeDisabled below).
      Instead, we use ntp in the VM:
      - set min/maxpoll intervals to force frequent polling.
        The lower limit is 3 (the manual is lying), corresponding to 2**3 == 8 seconds.
      - set `tinker panic 0` to avoid ntp erroring out due to large time diffs after
        pausing the VM.
        See e.g. https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/avoiding-clock-drift-vms

      unattended upgrades:
      unattended-upgrades is installed by default in the ubuntu/bionic64 box,
      this was apparently not the case for older versions. Installing it
      explicitly (above) for good measure.

      The default settings are in 50unattended-upgrades. We put our tweaks in a
      separate file, to avoid dpkg bickering about modified files when updating
      the unattended-upgrades package itself. Both files are processed in
      sequence, so our file has a chance to overwrite the default settings.
      The settings below are:
      - Origins-Pattern "origin=*": allows unattended-upgrades to install
        packages from any configured source; it will behave just
        like regular apt-get update.
        The default is more conservative; this enables updates for all system
        repos AND specifically for the scionlab package repo.
        C.f. https://github.com/mvo5/unattended-upgrades/blob/master/README.md
      - Automatic-Reboot: if a package update requires a reboot, the VM will
        reboot at 02:00.
      - Periodic::Update-Package-Lists/Unattended-Upgrade: the minimal interval
        in days between the consecutive action. Setting 'always' means that this
        happens everytime the systemd timer fires (see below).
      Helpful for testing/debugging:
      - check the effective settings by running `apt-config dump`
      - `unattended-upgrades --dry-run --debug`

      Modify the timers to trigger upgrades more frequently and at more
      dependable times; the default timers have large RandomizedDelay that we
      don't want.
      Also, ensure that the apt-daily-upgrade timer runs _after_ apt-daily, by
      removing RandomizedDelaySec on both timers and a few minutes offset in the OnCalendar.
      Otherwise, the upgrade step may act based on an old package list.
      Supposedly, the order is correct at boot due to an After=, but I was
      unable to verify this: c.f.
