# SCIONLab Dedicated
SCIONLab Dedicated System configuration

This is the SCION configuration for a dedicated system.


## Setup of the system

You need to install SCION to the system, and/or update it to the version you need, manually.
There is documentation on how to do it under:
https://netsec-ethz.github.io/scion-tutorials/native_setup/ubuntu_x86_build/
If you are running your AS not in a conventional Ubuntu system, check the more general:
https://netsec-ethz.github.io/scion-tutorials/

If, on the other hand, you wish SCION to be kept up to date automatically, and you don't mind running a VM, consider getting the configuration for a VM instead.


## Further information
