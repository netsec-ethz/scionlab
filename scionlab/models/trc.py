        Create a TRC for this ISD.

        Requires at least one core AS in this ISD.

        The latest certificates for all core ASes are used. The validity period for the TRC
        is determined based on the validity of these certificates.

        TRC Updates and Trust Reset
        ===========================
        All TRC updates must comply with the following:
        - The ISD identifier must not change.
        - The base identifier must not change.
        - noTrustReset must not change.
        - Votes must belong to sensitive or regular certificates present in the previous TRC.
        - The number of votes >= previous TRC votingQuorum.
        - Every 'sensitive voting cert' and 'regular voting cert' that are new in
          this TRC, attach a signature to the TRC.

        A TRC update is a regular update if:
        - The voting quorum does not change.
        - The core ASes section does not change.
        - The authoritative ASes section does not change.
        - The number of sensitive, regular and root certificates does not change.
        - The set of sensitive certificates does not change.
        In regular TRC updates, votes must be cast with regular voting keys.

        If a TRC update is not a regular update, it is called a sensitive update.
        In sensitive TRC updates, votes must be cast with sensitive voting keys.

        The alternative to a TRC update is a trust reset, where a TRC with a new base identifier is
        created. A trust reset breaks the chain of trust, and cannot be verified from the existing
        material. Typically this means that a base TRC has to be copied to the ASes, so that the
        trust is placed manually.

        create(...) will attempt to update the TRC in the lightest way possible, that is
        1. regular TRC update, if possible
        2. sensitive TRC update, if possible,
        3. create a new base TRC (trust reset)
